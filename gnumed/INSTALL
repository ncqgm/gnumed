Installation instructions
-------------------------

If you checked out GnuMed from CVS or downloaded the tarball
there is nothing to install really. Everything can be run
right from the directory where you put the files (this will
change when we package releases).

You need to make sure, however, that you have all the necessary
3rd party components installed. For this use:

	check-prerequisites.sh

You can bootstrap a database with help of the shell scripts in

    gnumed/server/bootstrap/

But you don't have to ! You can also connect the client to one
of the public servers. Look at the GnuMed Wiki for connection
info.

You can then run the client with help of the shell scripts in

	gnumed/client/

If questions arise, please ask on the mailing list at

	http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnumed-devel


Enjoy !
