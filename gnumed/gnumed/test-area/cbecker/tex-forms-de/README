Hallo Karsten,
Thank you for your detailed answer.
I tried the  bootstrapping process again and it worked a little better, 
but at last I was unable to install gnumed. Perhaps I should try it on a 
linux machine, but at the moment don't have Linux on any computer any more.
I downloaded the schema and tryed to install it via psql. With this 
there were (at least) the following problems:
First
A pg_dump does not dump any groups and users. Thus , if a db schema 
needs any users and groups to be installed, it should come with a 
sql-script which will install those users and groups.
Second
PLpgsql could not be installed with gnumeds schema-dump, which resulted 
in many errormessages. The reason seems to be that the pg_dump of gnumed 
contains the following statement:

CREATE FUNCTION plpgsql_call_handler() RETURNS language_handler
    AS '/usr/lib/postgresql/plpgsql.so', 'plpgsql_call_handler'
    LANGUAGE c;

This will not work on any windows machine, at least if a nativ 
PostgreSQL 8.01 is running.
I don't know wether this was/is a bug.  The question is which version of 
PostgreSQL was used to dump the gnumed-schema.
A dump done with PostgreSQL 8.01 on Windows XP works around the problem 
with the librarypath by using a variable $libdir instead of a Unix-like 
path:
CREATE FUNCTION plpgsql_call_handler() RETURNS language_handler
    AS '$libdir/plpgsql', 'plpgsql_call_handler'
    LANGUAGE c;

By the way, Dezign for Databases reports that, Gnumed has 184 Tables 
with 1024 Columns.
This obvious complexity, together with the difficutly to get the backend 
running (on Windows)  may be a bit deterrent for anybody who realy wants 
to develop a GUI.

Because of at least three bugs in the Dezign for Database Schema-import, 
I can not produce a correct database schema at the moment. At least two 
of this bugs can be worked arround with a filter, which is just a 
question of time.
I am a bit interested in Gnumed, since I have to write an appoint gui 
(and backend) too in the next month's.
But at the moment I have big enough problems with the new German denture 
regulations.

The RoteListe Windows CD  is  distributed free at least German dentists. 
It has an active-x-interface which should be usable from within 
wxPython  and it has the possibility to export data for prescriptions 
into a file, which can be read by other applications.

I do have LATEX forms for the German Kassenrezept and the 
Arbeitsunfähigkeistbescheinigung.
I attatch the texfiles. The worked with an Epson LQ630 Matrixprinter, 
but should work on almost any printer after adjusting the 0 point. I 
used the Latex picture envirement and set the lower left corner of the 
KVK-Data-Frame as zero point.
I should be clear, that the variable names within the stars ** should be 
replaced via a python script.
May be you can use them for Gnumed. I too have a form for private 
invoices, using the DIN-letter and the long-table envirement. By this 
one can write multi-page invoices. Notice that latex has to be called 
more than once to get nice tables with longtable.
My invoiceform  may be usefull for GPs too after some modification.
As far as I can see, a search for *.tex in gnu med does not show 
anything like this.
I attach some more tex-files. elab_beleg.tex  is used to write dental 
laboratory invoices for in office laboratory work. kvkdaten.tex and 
kzvstempel.tex are modules used by several forms like the 
Arbeistunfaehigkeisbescheiniugng und the and the prescription.
