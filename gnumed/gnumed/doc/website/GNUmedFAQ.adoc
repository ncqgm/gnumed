[[WhatIsGnuMed]] *What is GNUmed?*

=== The Project

GNUmed is a group of practising doctors, programmers and free
software enthusiasts from around the world, committed to
provide a superior, free, libre, open soure software solution
for community practice.

=== For Users

GNUmed is an Electronic Medical Record software. It offers
record-keeping, but aims to cover all aspects of medical
practice, and attempts to interface well with third-party
software.

=== For Developers

GNUmed is using tried-and-true technology to do things
technically "cleanly" taking a pragmatic rather than purist
approach. It is a client/server application largely written
in https://www.python.org[Python]. It safely operates on
single computers or networks with few to many users, and
supports secure remote access.

The GUI is using the https://www.wxpython.org[wxPython] toolkit.

Data is stored in a https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL RDBMS].

The reference platform for deployment is
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gnumed-client[Debian] 
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gnumed-server[GNU/Linux]
but by design and choice of technology GNUmed should run on
all of Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

[[WhatGnuMedNot]] *What is GNUmed _not_ ?*

GNUmed is not currently intended for hospitals.

GNUmed is, however, intended to interface well with such
systems. There may also be some departments (such as hospital
associated general ambulatory care) that warrant use of
GNUmed.

'''''

[[WhoGnuMedFor]] *Who is GNUmed for ?*

GNUmed is suitable for any health care provider interested in
keeping a sound and comprehensive longitudinal medical
record. It can be used on a single computer or with a network
of several workstations.

It is currently in use with GPs and physical therapists.

[[IsGnuMedApproved]] *Is GNUmed "approved software" ?*

GNUmed has not yet been submitted for national certifications. For more
information, see link:CertificationRequirements[here].

'''''

[[WhyIsGnuMedTheWayItIs]] *Why is GNUmed the way it is?*

The design paradigm for GNUmed aims to achieve the widest possible
(global) usability. This explains the desire to maintain conceptual
separation (if not functional) between what is truly relevant to a
patient's health record --- from a health and patient benefit point of
view --- and the administration and the work processes (including
billing) that surround it.

If one approaches development instead from the point of view of doctors'
workflows, where the primary purpose of the patient data structure is to
support the doctors' billing, appointment-making and other tasks, you
get an entirely different data design, in which patient information gets
tucked into tables to serve the tables' interests, rather than the
patients'... the patient "record" thereby becoming a secondary
consideration. You end up with an entirely different paradigm, one that
is not broadly (internationally), let alone (necessarily) nationally
usable. GNUmed's founders would consider that a tragedy. In the
gnumed-devel archive can be found postings that suggest GNUmed to
"resist" GUI and workflow considerations. More accurately, there is only
the position that – however important may be the workflow considerations
– these need to be built from, and to remain built on, a _meaningful_
patient record.

[[WhatComputerSystems]] *What computer system(s) will it run on?*

GNUmed has been installed on Unix, GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOSX systems
(however the Mac version depends on a technical piece to catch up).
Usage of the newest (experimental) versions is suggested only for
developers, and others with some more advanced computing and/or
programming experience. As our community and help base grows,
"installer" packages are being created and maintained for a variety of
systems, linked from _...downloading, installing_ in the GettingStarted
topic.

link:#TopOfFAQ[top]

'''''

[[IsGnuMedFree]] *Is GNUmed free? Why?*

GNUmed, in common with most open source software (OSS), is free but in a
special way. If somebody has access to source code they could modify it,
create something new and then patent the new program. They might choose
not to release the source code so they could make money from their new
program. The resulting program would no longer be open source and others
could not improve or adapt it if they wanted to.

One of the key elements of OSS is its licensing conditions. Certain
licences can specifically prevent something like this from happening.
There are a number of OS (Open Source) licences, and examples of the
most common ones can be found at [http://www.opensource.org/licenses].
The original and most widely known licence is the GNU General Public
Licence (GPL). Under the GNU GPL you can use, copy, modify or even sell
free software but the software must come with either the source files or
access to the source files. If you were to sell the software, or modify
it and then sell it, the GPL requires that such software also be covered
by the GPL. Thus, you are required to let the buyer know that they can
have the source code and they have the right to use it or modify it if
they wish. They must also be told that the program is sold under the GNU
General Public Licence. The effect of the GPL is that OSS is rarely sold
and that most vendors make their money instead by installing OS software
and otherwise supporting end users.

GNUmed is being released under the GPL because medical software is
evolving from mere administrative tools towards powerful decision
support systems. It is predictable that we will soon reach a state where
software might make better and safer decisions than unexperienced
doctors. This will sooner or later result in situations where a
patient's health or even life depends on using the most sophisticated
software. Given the infinite replicability of software at negligible
cost, it would feel unethical to prevent those in need from having
access to that software.

[[OpenSourceImplications]] *What more should I know about Free and Open
Source?*

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are philosophies, initiatives, and
licensing frameworks. They encourage and support models in which source
code must be distributed along with the software, and that the source
code be freely modifiable, with at most minor restrictions. Some myths
about Open Source are discussed in an article available
http://www.cio.com/archive/030104/open.html[online].

With proprietary software, modification including security holes, bug
fixes, and enhancements are under the sole control of the
developer/vendor in terms of timing as well as whether they ever occur.
With GNUmed, these improvements can be done at any time.

With Free and Open Source, "computer people" will still be needed to
attend to set up, maintenance and troubleshooting of the computers and
software. Users will still need to get trained. An ecosystem will need
to get developed, to sustain and improve the software and the installed
user base. Perspectives on how this can be done include

[[GnuMedCost]] *What might it cost to run?*

The cost (time and financial) to install, maintain, support and improve
the software in one's medical practice does not fit a traditional model.
With proprietary software a vendor sells you a "run-time copy" or a
license to use their software, with built-in or optional annual
maintenance, upgrade, and support costs. Sales and support of computer
equipment and networking are sometimes also provided, and this package
can have administrative appeal (i.e. the "one stop shop").

As GNUmed can be obtained without fee, self-sufficient persons will find
their only costs will relate to their hardware and, for multi-user and
remote access, to their network. Some Free and Open Source communities
have been able to identify and provide economically priced hardware
solutions --- see for example a http://oscarservice.com/[service company
built around the OSCAR project] _Caveat: While GNUmed may itself cost
nothing, "full" EMR and practice support is unlikely to be achieved
until later versions, and so some users may want/need, in the meantime,
to use some non-Open Source software alongside GNUmed._

The costs of self-sufficiency must also be kept in mind. The ability to
install, configure and troubleshoot (to the point of debugging) packages
on your operating system(s) is needed, as well training and support for
your own office staff. Even if you are _able_ to do this you may find
this erodes your total time available, and causes the disruption to your
medical practice activities, and your enjoyment may come more from
helping to improve GNUmed than in doing all of your own support.

Most doctors will want or need skilled computer support people to do
some or all of their computing support. Especially for a first
implementation you would want or need to secure ample help with the
hardware and network design plus software installation and configuration
and training. Once your system is functioning smoothly you will likely
want to structure an arrangement in which these people provide a base
amount of ongoing support, with additional service on a "pay as you go"
basis. Because you are unlikely to need a full-time person (at least not
on an ongoing basis) it will make tremendous sense to co-ordinate your
needs with those of one or more other GnuMed-based medical practices in
order to make feasible a critical mass of sustainable local support.

Having said all of the above a few ballpark numbers may be helpful
predicated on i) Free and Open Source costing the same or less for
support and ii) your _NOT_ having to pay acquisition costs, nor pre-pay
for future development --- you would only pay towards any of those
GNUMed core enhancements, or customizations, whose costs --- time,
energy or money --- would make sense to share. Using some non-Free/Open
Source systems as a basis for comparison, in Canada, EMR vendors have
been known to charge on average USD equivalents of $1500 – 2100 per
full-time doctor for installation, support, and any bug-fixes and
feature-enhancements issued within the year, more
http://www.oscarcanada.org/about-oscar/brief-overview[here]. Talk to
some local computer support people to assist you with some calculations.
As soon as we collect any of our own real examples of costs, we can
share the information.

[[HowLearnMore]] *How can I learn more and perhaps contribute?*

* Become a local advocate for Free and Open Source software, and help
prepare your colleagues and health agencies for its use
* Track GNUmed's progress via the mailing list (presently only the
http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnumed-devel[developer] list has
activity), and share your ideas with the others on the list
* We can always use help with building packages, to make it easier for
end-users to install and try GNUmed, see link:BinaryPackages[here].
* Easy-to-do bug fixes and/or wishlist items (which may not be bugs)
have been tagged over at our Launchpad account, go to
https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnumed/+bugs?advanced=1["Bugs in GNUmed:
Advanced Search"] and, under Tags, put in "easy-to-do".
* One of the ways of getting involved with coding in a project is by
looking at bug reports and read into the code and try to figure out
where the bug could be. One doesn't really have to find it or fix it,
just trying to find it will make one think about how the code is put
together. Pick a bug, a todo or a mini project and start asking.

[[LoginFailures]] *I cannot log in with the client ?*

PostgreSQL must be installed on a computer on your network.

A GNUmed server package must be installed on that computer.

The package provides tools to create a database suitable for
use with GNUmed clients. These tools may need to be run
manually to actually set up the database.

The database version and client version must suitably match.

Database access credentials must have been set up and entered
into the login dialog.

Default credentials are _any-doc_ / _any-doc_ (*do change
them* !).

A public database (publicdb.gnumed.de) can be used for testing.

You may want to enlist professional support for setup and administration.

[[GNUmedPasswords]] *What are the passwords needed during database setup ?*

GNUmed works with a number of passwords to provide database security as
well as to identify users. What passwords are asked or preseeded depends
largely on the operating systems you are using as well as the mode of
installation. Generally speaking Windows users have the option to have
all passwords preset for them. More advanced users have the option to
have all to none supplied. On Linux it depends on the installation
method. Usually if you know the password for user 'root' it will not ask
any password work out of the box.

* *Passwords on MS Windows - boostrapping*
** If you installed from the All-in-One package the following password
are preset:
*** MS Windows-system user 'postgres' has the password 'servicepassword'
*** the database user 'gm-dbo' has the password 'gm-dbpass'
*** the database administrator 'postgres' has the password
'postgrespassword'

* *Passwords on Linux* * You will be asked the password for the user
gm-dbo. The very first time there is no password. So whatever you give
as a response value for the password will be set as password for the
future. You need this password to add staff accounts to GNUmed.

[[GnumedTranslations]] *Is GNUmed available in Spanish, German, French,
Dutch ... ?*

GNUmed is designed to support almost any language. Translations range
from complete to just started. For a quick overview visit

'''''

[[DoIneedClientAndServer]] *Do I need _client_ or _server_ or both ?*

GNUmed consists of a client part and a server part.

The server stores all data and the client enables users to
work with that data during the care process.

One usually needs one server part and one or multiple clients
installed per office. There are separate downloads for the
client and the server part.
