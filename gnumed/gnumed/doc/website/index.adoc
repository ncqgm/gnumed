The *GNUmed* project builds a Free, Libre, Open Source *Electronic Medical Record* +
in multiple languages to assist and improve longitudinal care (specifically in +
ambulatory settings, i.e. multi-professional practices and clinics). +

It is made available at no charge and is capable of running on GNU/Linux, +
Windows and Mac OS X. It is developed by a handful of medical doctors and +
programmers from all over the world.

It can be *useful to* anyone documenting the health of patients including, +
but not limited to, *doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, +
acupuncturists, nurses, psychologists* ...

Please use the links above to *download and install the client*, be
aware that the _public_ server is sometimes a little slow -- give it
about 30s to respond to each screen change or refresh that you make. You
can of course create your own _local_ server database -- please see the
_Installation Guides_ above.
