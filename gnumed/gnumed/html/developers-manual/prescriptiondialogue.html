  <h1>The Prescription Dialogue</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The prescription dialogue pops up after selecting a drug from the drug selection list control,
or after hiting the quick script button. If invoked from the quick script button, all details
will be blank but the patient name and the prescription date. If invoked from the drug selection
control, the drug details will be filled in as well.

<b>The Rx combo box</b> shows the full text of the prescription item as selected from the drug
selection control. It may be just a generic name or a brand name including formulation and
strength. It responds to the following events in addition to the standard events:
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>double click:</b> the drug selection control pops up and allows searching the full drug
  data base <br>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>drop combo box:</b> a list with frequently prescribed drugs drops down for quick selection.
  The number of drugs, the method of selection (automatic from prescription frequency or
  manual list) and the current list contents are stored on the database backend for each user
  separately. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Quantity / Repeats</b> Obvious. Quantity and repeats / refills of the prescribed medication.
Either select context sensitive choice from the combo drop down or enter arbitrary values at
your own risk.
</p>

<p>
<b>Refund radio buttons:</b> arbitrary number of radio buttons to allow for different
pharmaceutical benefit schemes; the example shows the typical Australian configuration.
</p>

<p>
<b>Patient name field:</b> although this dialogue is typically invoked from within GNUMed, and
a patient is already preselected, this combo text control allows for entering a different name
(which is consequently searched for in the database as soon as the control looses the focus).
Purpose is to allow the user to write quick scripts for example when a consultatiion is interrupted
by a phone call made by a different patient requesting an urgen script.
</p>

<p>
<b>Date field:</b> Allows to manually override the default date which is the current date.
Depending on regulations and certain situations, predated and "retrospective" script can be neccessary
</p>

<p>
<b>Reason:</b> This field allows to connect one or more diagnoses to this medication. A double click
allows to choose from the code browser dialogue (which lists the past and present diagnoses of this patient too).
Dropping down the combo box reveals the active and long term problems of this patient.
If free text is entered, the control searches the database for this diagnosis; if not found,
the user is prompted for a code when the control ooses the focus. If more than one reason has to be entered,
a comma separated free text will be accepted. Alternatively, a click with the right mouse button will
present more options.
</p>

<p>
<b>Include in summary</b>If unticked, this prescription will not be listed in teh patient's
prescription summary. Default is on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Strength</b>This combinations control consists in 3 elements. The first combo box allows
to enter the strength as packed, the second combo box allows to modify this (like 25 mg strength,
modification 1/2 tbl). The combo drop down of the stregth attribute is prefilled with the pre-packed
alternative of the selected generic drug, but can be overridden manually.<br>
The list box below simply lists more verbose the alternative strength available; if clicked, the
selected option is pasted into the strength combo box. Single selection only.
</p>

<p>
<b>Frequency:</b> the combo box is prefille with the recommended frequncies for the selected drug.
The list box below displays common administration alternatives which are pasted into the combo box by
clicking / selecting. Single selection only.
</p>

<p>
<b>Instructions:</b> Free text field which allows to enter any length of custom instructions for
this prescription.<br>
The list box below lists common instructions which are pasted into the text field by clicking / selecting.
Multiple selections are allowed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning buttons:</b> They are dynamically coloured if any of the categories might have a relevance for
this prescription. Ideally, they will be contect sensitive (aware of gender, age, pregnancy / lactation status
and diseases. When a button is clicked, details are displayed. If the user has an aversion against up-poppiong
warning dialog boxes, he can configure GNUMed so that the colour / flashing of the warning buttons will be the
only warning he gets.
