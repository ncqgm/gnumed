------------------
referrals handling
------------------
maintainer:
hackers:
 - accompanying referral letter
   - use wxWindows-internal styled text editing widget
     - reText ?
	 - StyledTextCtrl ?
	 - Scintilla ?
   - FUTURE: AbiWord IMHO for letters that need a little writing
   - DISCUSS LATER: quick-pick lists+LaTeX+text editor for "rapid-letter" referrals
 - referral form (Germany)
   - either common forms engine with prescription or hard-coded via EditArea
   - optional

------------
prescription
------------
maintainer:
hackers: Ian Haywood, RMIT
 - *very* complex to cover all cases
 - start with simple, most common cases:
 - print out using common forms engine
 - 4 fields initially:
   - drug name, auto-complete from database
   - strengths, drop-down from list in database
   - frequency, free-form for now, later recognize formats
     - German: 4 integers for the 4 times during the day, separated by slashes,
	   so 4 times a day is "1/1/1/1", one morning , 2 at night is "1/0/2/0"
     - Latin: m=mane, i=midi n=nocte, b=BD t=TDS, q=QID.
	   So "2m" is 2 tabs mane, "1q" is 1 tab QID, "2m+2.5i" is 2 mane and 2 & a half midi
   - directions. Free comment fields, auto-translating to vernacular for
     standard Latin abbreviations: PP, OU, AU, etc.

 - FUTURE: remembers previous values for a particular drug
   - should come automatically with XML forms proposal

 - OPTIONAL: a "prescribing diagnosis" field which saves as
   a Plan row into the SOAP for the currently active encounter

 - Scripts will be lawful in Australia: name, address, Medicare number, prescriber, etc.

------------------------
drug information browser
------------------------
maintainer: ? RMIT ?
hackers: Hilmar Berger
 - if data is available locally
 - PBS via drugref.org via XML-RPC, initially
 - AMIS (German) to follow

========================
OPTIONAL (post-release):
--------------------

------------
path results
------------
maintainer:
hackers: Karsten Hilbert, 
 - one excellently defined area of work
 - high on list for DE/AU
 - easily assignable sub-project
 - import PIT path files, def: <URL missing>
 - see gmMeasurement.sql
 - need to add country-specific tables in sql/country.specific/*/

 - optional: AU pathology request codes: <URL>
 - future: LOINC/LDT

--------
contacts
--------
maintainer:
hackers:

Have an XML-RPC server "contacts". This server spans possibly
several sources: a) The service "administration" which includes
the practice's configuration, eg. the practices contacts
database. This is the schema we control and use for
efficient/rapid selection. b) The service "reference". This
will contain reference data for those countries where "official"
contacts data is distributed on CD or by download (eg. in
Germany). We also control this schema but it is also more
closely modelled to the reference source data layout. Of
course, there would be facilities to say something like "move
all cardiologists in the SF bay area into the practice contact
database" (eg filling the local contacts from the reference
source) - this may go as far as making their *content*
identical (but not necessarily their layout). c) Access to
online, remote, official repositories (these are most likely
going to be LDAP or PKI key server type things).

Again, the server "contacts" would encapsulate this into one
API. When the user hits "widen search" it adds the reference
data sources to the match scope. Any selected contact will be
transferred from the reference source to the local contacts
repository automatically (the abovementioned scripts "move all
of ... into the local repository" will still be there for bulk
transfers/updates).
