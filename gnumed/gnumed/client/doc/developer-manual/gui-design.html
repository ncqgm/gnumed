>5.5.2. Date Entry Paradigm - The Editing Area</H2
><P
>Medical information usually can be presented as groups of 4-10 parameters. 
		    It is therefore possible to come up with a gui design for data entry where 
		      all segments of a medical records program use the same format of data input. 
		    In GnuMed this fact is reflected by a graphic 
		      design that is called the 'editing area'. 
		    </P
><P
>The area of the screen where data is entered (`editing area´) will be implemented as an widget which can be customized to the various groups of medical information. </P
><P
>This editing area does not 'pop up' in a window. It stays in the same place 
		      on the screen but changes appearance according to the type of data the user 
		      is entering.</P
><P
> Because it looks and functions the same, no matter 
		      what category of data is being entered, there is no need to for the user to 
		      learn how to use multiple sections of a program, no need to have multiple different 
		      designs of pop up dialogs as is common in most medical programs.</P
><P
>In addition, as a programmer will quickly realise, 
		      it can lead to a reduction in computer code needed to generate the display and 
		      call in information from the database for contextual display, as generic subroutines 
		      can be developed to work across all sections of medical information. </P
><P
>In most sections of the program the user enters 
		      very little information as most of it will be 'autofilled' in by the program. In GnuMed, The 
		      context of the editing area can be called from a button bar. </P
><P
>In the following there are shown some examples of it's implementation. 
		      These screen dumps have been taken from an already functional VisualBasic-based medical records program written by Richard Terry. 
		      The graphical interface of GnuMed will be quite similiar to that of some of the examples shown.
		      First examples of variations of the editing area, followed by screen 
		      dumps of the whole program, accompanied by comments by Richard Terry.</P

>5.5.3. Full Screen Design</H2
><P
>The following is the rough 
		      template used for designing the whole screen. The proportions are roughly 
		      shown below.</P
><P
>		      Though the area designated 
		      for the tab control (which contains lists for medications, pathology, referral 
		      letters, recalls etc) may seem small, in practice it works well. There is enough 
		      room here for eg 10-14 medications and if filled, that in itself would indicate 
		      the patient was probably suffering from poly-pharmacy!. Other lists eg pathology 
		      are viewed in decending order, ie most recent to least recent, and are usually 
		      able to be sorted by date/type of request etc hence information is easily seen 
		      or quickly found. Just how many requests/referrals/recalls does the average 
		      patient have in year anyway, usually very few.</P
><P
>The 'scratch pad' area I've found immensely useful. 
		      The doctor enters free hand text here for those little reminders one needs which 
		      may not be 'medical reminders' or could be personal memory joggers for the doctor.</P
><P
>The lower right hand area contains any outstanding 
		      reviews/recalls which are presented as the recall name and months due/overdue.</P
><P
>The size of the left hand rectangle (which here 
		      contains the editing area and some lists) is large enough and proportionately 
		      sized enough to display a variety of information e.g. referral letter text, 
		      pathology results, imaging results, graphs with decision support. I.e, one could 
 clicking on the drug display 
		      its product information, or if browsing the pathology list display the results 
		      of a test in this area</P
><P
>The editing area always occupies the central portion 
		      of this area and changes display according to the section of the program one 
		      is working on, although it may at times be temporarily covered by a display 
		      which uses the whole of this left hand pane.</P
><P
>The best way to see how this all works is to view 
		      the screen dumps shown on the following pages.</P
