>&#62; I would be interested in hearing about the database design 
&#62; history and the purpose of the distributed database architecture
&#62; that you have implemented, (smart, but possibly a little 
&#62; over-kill I would have thought at first glance).

>	    Horst Herb:The main reason why we had to split the monolithic backend up:
- some countries provide centralized demographic information. It would 
be inefficient and unreliable to try to copy such a centrally well 
maintained demographic database. We should rather allow to tap into it 
via distributed services.
- some countries provide centralized pharmaceutical information
- some countries provide centralized immunisation databases
- some conutries centralize certain pathology results
etc.

Sometimes, this happens on a smaller scale like within a hospital where 
they already have successfully implemented some of these services, they 
are running smoothly, and they find no reason to pull it apart again. 
GNUMed will shine in such an environment because it will be far easier 
to integrate into such existing solutions than other software.

Thus we try to find out which "services" are relatively independent from 
others, and isolate them into particular "virtual" databases. That 
way, it will be magnitudes easier to write simple wrappers for external 
sources and use them.

The main obstacle is tha Postgres in itself does not support 
cross-database queries, and we have to take care of referential 
integrity between external sources ourselves.

Note: we should put in a description on how this is achieved now
(client side) vs. how we would want this (either built into postgres
or via a dedicated demon on the backend with listen/notify)

>	    Karsten Hilbert: 
There isn't really much choice: Doing everything in one
monolithic database isn't quite flexible enough (distributed
practices with a WAN link, remote clinical repository but
local drug information data store). The difference between
hardcoding 2 or 3 database and doing it the Right Way as we
are trying to do now isn't very much of a difference. So there
aren't really many steps inbetween "monolithic" and
"distributed according to some configuration". Yes, it's a bit
more complex but to the client side it shouldn't be any more
complex than:

dbbrooker.GetConnection('personalia')
dbbrooker.GetConnection('BLOBS')

If we then properly encapsulate accesses into objects we don't
experience too much pain in using the distributed version.

It does get a bit more involved with keeping strict
referential integrity across databases but Horst can explain
the issues better than me.
