> compliant database adapters. Since there are still a few ambiguities
	    in the API definition, and furthermore some important PostgreSQL specific
	    features not accessible via DB-API, we have decided to focus mainly on one
	    specific adaper: <A

>. This
	    should not be a problem, since it is highly portable. We have succesfully
	    compiled it so far on different flavours of Linux and BSD, on different versions
	    of Windows, and on Mac OS/X.
	    </P

>	    In order to understand how to access the backend in principle, you'll have
	    to understand the <A
HREF="http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>	    DB-API specifications</I

	    <A

	    </P
><P
>	    Next, you'll have to understand the concept of "<A
HREF="services.html"
>	    services</A
>" in GnuMed. Fortunately, most of the complexity behind services
	    is handled by the service broker object <A
HREF="python-common.html#GMPG"
>	    gmPG</A
>. gmPG will also handle a lot of other complex issues such as gathering
	    log in information in order to make backend connections in the first place.
	    </P
><P
>	    PostgreSQL is fully transactional. Transactions (sequences of database modifications)
	    are only "committed" if the server is told so, otherwise the transactions
	    are rolled back (changes will not be visible in the database). Rollbacks
	    happen automatically if an error occurs during a transaction that may affect
	    the integrity of the database, but the rollback can also be initiated programmatically. 
	    PostgreSQL "commits" happen on connection level. If a connection has several
	    active cursors (which it may at any time), a "commit" will affect all of
	    these cursors.
	    </P
><P
>	    Thus, in order not to interfere accidentally with other transactions, any
	    client action that modifies the backend database MUST request a separate
	    connection. However, establishing a connection is ressource intensive and
	    costs time, even if it is only milliseconds on a LAN. Since most of the database
	    interaction is typically read-only, where we don't have to fear transactional
	    collisions, we don't need to establish extra costly connections for the client
	    objecst that just want to read the database without modifying it.
	    </P
><P
>	    Since we want to make gnumed as resistant to programmatic errors as reasonably
	    possible, we have decided to make sure that write access will not happen
	    accidentally through a "read-only" connection. Unfortunately,PostgreSQL provides
	    no simple way of achieving this. Our current solution is that a pseudo-user
	    is created for each user; the user gets only read-only access, the pseudo-user
	    gets res &#38; write access. Once again, this is handled entirely transparent
	    by <A
HREF="python-common.html#GMPG"
>	    gmPG</A
>. If a read-only connection is requested, gmPG will return an open
	    connection from a pool of shared connections. If a writeable connection is
	    requested, gmPG opens a new connection under the alias of the pseudo-user
	    associated with the current user.
	    </P
><P
>	    For a practical example, let us assume we want to access a person's demographic
	    details. From the "<A
HREF="services.html"
>services table</A
>" we know
	    that this information is available through the service "personalia". Our
	    request for a read-only connection would look like this:

	    </P

>	    That's all! If we are already logged in, gmPG will use the cached login information.
	    If not, gmPG will determine whether we are using a graphical user interface
	    and display a nice login dialogue, otherwise it will ask for login parameters
	    via command line. Then, gmPG will determine in which physical database the
	    service "personalia" is located, and return that connection.
