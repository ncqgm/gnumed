    <H3>Introduction</H3>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  The <A HREF="http://www.egenix.com/">eGenix.com</A> mx
	  Extensions for Python are a collection of professional
	  quality Python software tools which enhance <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>'s usability in many
	  important areas such as ODBC database connectivity, fast
	  text processing, date/time processing and web site
	  programming.

	<P>
	  The tools have a proven record of being portable across many
	  Unix and Windows platforms, e.g. you can write applications
	  which use an ODBC database on Windows which then run on Unix
	  platforms without change due to the consistent platforms
	  independent interfaces.

	<P>
	  All of the available packages have shown their stability
	  and usefulness in many mission critical applications and
	  various commercial settings all around the world.

	<P>
	  The two most well-known packages from the mx Extension
	  Series are <A HREF="#mxDateTime">mxDateTime</A> and <A
	  HREF="#mxODBC">mxODBC</A> providing date/time services and
	  professional ODBC database connectivity on practically all
	  supported Python platforms. These two packages enable
	  database software which is portable not only across
	  platforms, but also across database backends.

    </UL>

    <H3>News</H3>

    <UL>

      <LI>
	mxODBC, mxDateTime and all other mx packages are now
	maintained by my new company <A
	HREF="http://www.egenix.com/">eGenix.com Software GmbH,
	Langenfeld</A> in Germany. This move will provide a better
	base for future development and also assures the availability
	of <B><A HREF="#Support">commercial support</A></B>, which is
	important for companies building applications based on the
	eGenix.com mx Extensions.
	<P>

      <LI>
	The new versions of the eGenix.com mx Extensions use the
	<B>Python 2.0 distutils packaging technology</B> to simplify
	installation and use of the many different subpackages. This
	is expected to greatly enhance the installation and usage
	experience of the software.
	<P>
	  
      <LI>
	In additions to many subpackage enhancements, this new release
	repackages all mx Extensions under a <B>new top-level package
	named 'mx'</B>. This will allow you to use the subpackages
	side-by-side with other Python tools using similar names.
	<P>

      <LI>
	The software is now delivered in two download archives: the <A
	HREF="#mxBASE">eGenix.com mx BASE package</A> which holds all
	the Open Source tools from the series and provides the basis
	for the other add-ons and the <A
	HREF="#mxCOMMERCIAL">eGenix.com mx COMMERCIAL package</A>
	which currently only contains the <A HREF="#mxODBC">mxODBC
	package</A>.  The two packages are covered by the <A
	HREF="mxLicense.html#Public">eGenix.com Public License</A> and
	the <A HREF="mxLicense.html#Commercial">eGenix.com Commercial
	License</A> respectively. Details about the licenses can be
	found on the <A
	HREF="http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxLicense.html">eGenix.com
	License Page</A>.
	<P>

    <A NAME="mxBASE">
      
    <HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">

    <H3>eGenix.com mx Extensions - BASE Package</H3>

    <DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>
      <SMALL>
	&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Version 2.0.3</FONT> &nbsp;
      </SMALL>
    </DIV>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  The BASE package contains the Open Source parts of the
	  eGenix.com mx Extension series. They are shipped under the new
	  <A HREF="mxLicense.html#Public">eGenix.com Public License
	  Agreement Version 1.0.0</A>. This license is an enhanced
	  version of the Python 2.0 license and allows you to use and
	  redistribute the <I>eGenix.com mx BASE</I> package in commercial
	  and non-commercial applications without having to pay a fee
	  or royalties.

	<P>
	  The following subpackages are included in the BASE package:

    <A NAME="mxDateTime">

    <H4><A HREF="mxDateTime.html">mxDateTime - Generic Date/Time Types</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxDateTime is an extension package that provides three new
	  object types, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime,
	  which let you store and handle date/time values in a much
	  more natural way than by using ticks (seconds since 1.1.70
	  0:00 UTC; the encoding used by the time module).
	
	<P>
	  You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle
	  and copy them and convert the results to strings, COM dates,
	  ticks and some other more esoteric values. In addition,
	  there are several convenient constructors and formatters at
	  hand to greatly simplify dealing with dates and times in
	  real-world applications.

	<P>
	  In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the
	  package also exports a comfortable C API interface for other
	  extensions to build upon. This is especially interesting for
	  database applications which often have to deal with
	  date/time values (the <A HREF="#mxODBC">mxODBC</A> package
	  is one example of an extension using this interface).

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxTextTools">

    <H4><A HREF="mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools - Fast Text Processing Tools</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxTextTools is an extension package for Python that provides
	  several useful functions and types that implement
	  high-performance text manipulation and searching algorithms
	  in addition to a very flexible and extendable state machine,
	  the Tagging Engine, that allows scanning and processing text
	  based on low-level byte-code "programs" written using Python
	  tuples.  It gives you access to the speed of C without the
	  need to do any compile and link steps every time you change
	  the parsing description.

	<P>
	  Applications include parsing structured text, finding and
	  extracting text (either exact or using translation tables)
	  and recombining strings to form new text.

    </UL>
      
    <A NAME="mxStack">

    <H4><A HREF="mxStack.html">mxStack - Fast and Memory-Efficient Stack Type</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxStack is an extension package that provides a new object
	  type called Stack. It works much like what you would expect
	  from such a type, having .push() and .pop() methods and
	  focusses on obtaining maximum speed at low memory costs.

    </UL>
    
    <A NAME="mxTools">

    <H4><A HREF="mxTools.html">mxTools - Collection of Additional Builtins</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxTools is an extension package that includes a collection
	  of handy functions and objects giving additional
	  functionality in form of new builtins to the Python
	  programmer.

	<P>
	  The package auto-installs the new functions and objects as
	  builtins upon first import. This means that they become
	  instantely available to all other modules without any
	  further action on your part. Add the line <CODE>import
	  mx.Tools.NewBuiltins</CODE> to your site.py script and they
	  will be available to all users at your site as if they were
	  installed in the Python interpreter itself.

    </UL>
    
    <A NAME="mxProxy">

    <H4><A HREF="mxProxy.html">mxProxy - Generic Proxy Wrapper Type</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxProxy is an extension package that provides a new type
	  that is suitable to implement Bastion like features without
	  the need to use restricted execution environments. 

	<P>
	  The type's main features are <I>secure data
	  encapsulation</I> (the hidden objects are not accessible
	  from Python since they are stored in internal C structures),
	  <I>customizable attribute lookup</I> methods and a
	  <I>cleanup protocol</I> that helps in breaking circular
	  references prior to object deletion.

	<P>
	  The latest version adds a very interesting new feature:
	  <I>weak references</I> which help you work with circular
	  references in a way that doesn't cause memory leakage in a
	  Python system.

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxBeeBase">

    <H4><A HREF="mxBeeBase.html">mxBeeBase - On-disk B+Tree Based Database Kit</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxBeeBase is a high performance construction kit for disk
	  based indexed databases. It offers components which you can
	  plug together to easily build your own custom mid-sized
	  databases (the current size limit is
	  <CODE>sizeof(long)</CODE> which gives you an address range
	  of around 2GB on 32-bit platforms).

	<P>
	  The two basic building blocks in mxBeeBase are
	  <I>storage</I> and <I>index</I>. Storage is implemented as
	  variable record length data storage with integrated data
	  protection features, automatic data recovery and locking for
	  multi process access. Indexes use a high performance
	  optimized B+Tree implementation built on top of <A
	  HREF="http://epaperpress.com/">Thomas Niemann</A>'s Cookbook
	  B+Tree implementation.

    <H4>Installation</H4>

    <UL>
    
	<P>
	  On Unix systems supporting the <B>RPM formats</B> the
	  package can be installed using the standard operating system
	  tools, e.g. <CODE>rpm -i egenix-mx-base-xxxx.rpm</CODE> will
	  install the package and <CODE>rpm -e
	  egenix-mx-base-xxxx</CODE> deinstall it. When installing
	  packages for multiple Python versions, be sure to first
	  install the RPM for the oldest Python version and then
	  proceed with the more recent ones (or use the
	  <CODE>--force</CODE> option to install them in any order).
	  Note that the above RPMs install the extensions into
	  /usr/local not /usr !

	<P>
	  On <B>Windows platforms</B> the preferred method for
	  installation is using the the Windows installer, since this
	  doesn't require a C compiler to be installed on the system.
	  Thanks to Thomas Heller the installer also support uninstall
	  using the standard Windows uninstall procedure.

	<P>
	  All other platforms can use the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</A>
	  based installation which allows building and installing the
	  package using the installed Python interpreter and the
	  standard system C compiler.  On such a system, unzip the
	  package archive to a temporary directory and then run
	  <CODE>python setup.py install</CODE> to install the package
	  and <CODE>python setup.py uninstall</CODE> to uninstall it
	  again.  Documentation about the usage of distutils (which is
	  part of Python 2.0) is available online at the <A

            <P><LI> Prepared the tools for Python 2.2.

	</UL>

	<P>Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2:

	<UL>

	    <LI> Added compiler support for Cygwin. Thanks to Mark
	    Hadfield for pointing out the necessary changes.

	    <P><LI> Reworked the RPM packaging for different Python
	    versions: you can now install the RPMs for different
	    Python versions side-by-side.

	    <P><LI> Updated a few packages, e.g. the mxDateTime
	    package.

	</UL>

	<P>Changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1:

	<UL>

	    <LI> Added back .h header files to the
	    mx-subdirectories. Third-party software was relying on
	    these files, but the distutils process did not include
	    them per default.

	    <P><LI> New release for Python 2.1.

	<P>Changes from 2.0.4 to 2.1.0:

	<UL>

	    <LI> The usual bunch of small ODBC driver compatibility

            <P><LI> Fixed a bug in the distutils extension building
            mechanism which causes the compiler to share object
            between multiple subpackages. This caused e.g. the
            unixODBC (which is built after the iODBC package in
            standard builds) to not use unixODBC, but iODBC instead.

	  On Unix systems supporting the <B>RPM formats</B> the
	  package can be installed using the standard operating system
	  tools, e.g. <CODE>rpm -i
	  egenix-mx-experimental-xxxx.rpm</CODE> will install the
	  package and <CODE>rpm -e egenix-mx-experimental-xxxx</CODE>
	  deinstall it. When installing packages for multiple Python
	  versions, be sure to first install the RPM for the oldest
	  Python version and then proceed with the more recent ones
	  (or use the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to install them in
	  any order).

	<P>
	  On <B>Windows platforms</B> the preferred method for
	  installation is using the the Windows installer, since this
	  doesn't require a C compiler to be installed on the system.
	  Thanks to Thomas Heller the installer also support uninstall
	  using the standard Windows uninstall procedure.

	<P>
	  All other platforms can use the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</A>
	  based installation which allows building and installing the
	  package using the installed Python interpreter and the
	  standard system C compiler.  On such a system, unzip the
	  package archive to a temporary directory and then run
	  <CODE>python setup.py install</CODE> to install the package
	  and <CODE>python setup.py uninstall</CODE> to uninstall it
	  again.  Documentation about the usage of distutils (which is
	  part of Python 2.0) is available online at the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/doc/">distutils
	  documentation</A> site.
