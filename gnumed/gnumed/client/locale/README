GUI text localization
=====================
The GNU gettext system is used to provide a user interface
translated into the local language. Currently only the
original English version and a German translation exist.

NOTE: $LANG corresponds to the ISO code for your language
NOTE: Requires gettext tools to be installed.

Message catalogs, related files and useful shell scripts
live in the directories below gnumed/client/locale/ .

How to translate the GnuMed UI
------------------------------
Those are the rough steps to get GnuMed translated
into your language:

- create a *.po file containing all English
  message strings
- merge this file with preexisting translations
  for your language
- translate the remaining non-translated English
  program strings into your language
- compile a binary message catalog (*.mo file) from
  the translated messages

Creating a *.po file
--------------------
With
 <create-gnumed_po.sh $LANG>
you can rescan the Python source for strings that need
translation. The result is merged with the file $LANG.po
which serves as a repository of previously translated
strings. You can then edit this file adding in more
translations for message strings. For this you can use
a simple text editor or any tool you wish (such as EMACS
po mode or kbabel) as long as you keep a copy of your
final results in $LANG.po as a repository for future
translations.

If you execute this script for the first time you will
end up with a $LANG.po file without any previous translations.
In this case you need to edit a few metadata entries at the
very top of the $LANG.po file such as the character set you
are using.

Hints for translations:
 - look at translations in other languages to get an idea
 - look at the source and/or the running GnuMed to find good translations
 - keep exactly the same number of %s, %d etc in your translation,
   they are formatting placeholders and will be replaced with
   certain data (such as file names) dynamically at runtime
 - if the file asks you to translate the empty string ("")
   go into the python source and remove the _() around the
   empty string,
   the empty string cannot be translated and _will_ produce errors
   because it is used as the message string ID for po-file
   metadata

Creating a *.mo file
--------------------
With 
 <create-gnumed_mo.sh $LANG>
you can compile a *.mo file from the message catalog source.
You will end up with a $LANG-gnumed.mo file.

Installation of translated messages
-----------------------------------
On a POSIX system (Linux, BSD, MacOSX, CygWin) the
$LANG-gnumed.mo file should be moved into
 /usr/share/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/
or the corresponding standard place. Alternatively you
can make symlinks from there to
 /usr/share/gnumed/client/locale/$LANG.mo

You need to name either the copy or the symlink "gnumed.mo".

On MS Windows you must create the following directories:
client/
 client/wxpython/
 client/locale/
  client/locale/$LANG/
   client/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/

You then need to move the $LANG-gnumed.mo to the
appropriate LC_MESSAGES directory (or make a symlink)
again under the name of "gnumed.mo".
