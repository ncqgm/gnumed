This directory contains Python code as generated from *.wxg
XML files by wxGlade. The classes define what certain parts
of the GUI look like. They are inherited from by actual UI
classes in client/wxpython/.

DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY !

(Unless you know exactly what you are doing. Editing may in
some cases be necessary to add import statements.)

The code may be overwritten the next time someone changes
the GUI with wxGlade and puts the new version back in here.
All your changes may be lost. If you want to make your
changes permanent edit the appropriate *.wxg file in
client/wxg/ (preferably using wxGlade), regenerate the GUI
code and put it here.
